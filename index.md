<h2><a id="projectbackground">Project Background</a></h2>
<br>
Worldreader is non-profit organization working to reduce illiteracy through its reading applications and sponsorship programs. The organization has a collection of over 40,000 books in more than 40 languages with the mission "to unlock the potential of millions of people through the use of digital books in places where access to reading material is very limited."
<br><br>
The project team approached Worldreader as their large collection generates significant amounts data and particularly through the <a href="https://www.worldreader.org/what-we-do/worldreader-mobile/">Worldreader Open Library for mobile phones application</a>.
<br><br>
Worldreader was interested in the proposal of examining their data and in particular the organization wanted to focus on the queries from their mobile application. The project's aim was to examine the search query data with Worldreader providing a dataset from their feature phone application search queries and the corresponding fields and all data provided anonymized and not including personal data in any form. Worldreader would provide supervision on the project and team members required to sign individualized agreements on data confidentiality.
<br><br><br><br>
<h2><a id="projectscope">Project Scope and Methodology</a></h2>
Analyse queries made by users on the feature phone application by using clustering techniques

to identify similar searches. Planned methodologies can include sentiment and similarity

analysis. Datasets from national libraries will be used to link with clustered search results the

texts identified. The result of the project will be to give Worldreader a better grasp on what their

users are interested in reading and algorithms that they can use to improve upon their search

queries and results in the future.

This proposal leaves open the possibility to extend further into recommenders if possible and

time permits the project team. If possible and time permitting, the Worldreader catalog can be

used by the team to generate a recommenders system.

Summary and methodology

Team meetings are going to be held together with Catherine from Worldreader every two

weeks.

Foreseen steps:

- Data cleaning

- Data enrichment with information taken from word thesaurus and National Libraries

- Data clustering using text analysis

- Identify search language and select searches in English

- Split searchers in Authors, Titles and “unknow text”

- Identify Book Category

- Identify Authors

- Clusterize the book list in k groups of items that Worldreader users could take as

a recommendation book list.

- Cluster validation with control file

- Script implementation in a development unit
